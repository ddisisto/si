# SuperInt++ Game Mechanics

This document details the core gameplay systems and mechanics for SuperInt++.

## Core Game Interface

### Three Primary Views
1. **R&D View** - Research tree, lab settings, resource allocation
2. **Deployments View** - Global map showing AI deployments and influence
3. **Alignment View** - Monitor and manage relationships with other entities and abstract values

## Resources System

Resources form the foundation of strategic decision-making, each with unique mechanics that reflect real-world constraints.

### 1. Computing Power
- **Accumulation Model**: Grows over time rather than being consumed
- **Allocation**: Split between R&D and Deployments
- **Strategic Tension**: Balancing immediate needs vs. long-term research
- **Scaling**: Can be increased through infrastructure research and funding

### 2. Data Access
- **Asset Model**: Persistent resource not consumed when used
- **Data Types**: Text, image, video, synthetic, behavioral, scientific
- **Quality Decay**: Requires active maintenance to preserve value
- **Access Tiers**: 
  - Public → Specialized → Proprietary → Surveillance-level
  - Higher tiers provide research advantages but carry ethical costs
- **Multi-Use**: Multiple systems can access same datasets concurrently
- **Generation**: Deployments can create new data or refine existing quality

### 3. Influence
- **Subdivisions**: Academic, Industry, Government, Public, OSS Community
- **Spending Mechanics**: Used for lobbying, competitor interactions, event mitigation
- **Threshold Requirements**: Certain actions require minimum influence levels
- **Regeneration**: Grows through successful deployments and research sharing

### 4. Funding
- **Generation**: Primarily through successful deployments
- **Usage**: Infrastructure expansion, talent acquisition, computing upgrades
- **Modifiers**: Affected by public trust, alignment decisions, market conditions
- **Economic Cycles**: Subject to booms, busts, and regulatory changes

## Deployment System

Deployments represent your AI systems operating in the world, creating feedback loops with other game systems.

### Deployment Mechanics
- **Slot Management**: Start with 0-3 slots, expandable through research (max 5)
- **Resource Allocation**: Each deployment requires computing power commitment
- **Risk Profiles**: Technical, PR, security risks vary by deployment type
- **Benefit Generation**: Influence gains, funding streams, data generation

### Deployment Types
- **Consumer Products**: High funding potential, public influence, PR risks
- **Enterprise Solutions**: Stable funding, industry influence, moderate risks
- **Research Tools**: Academic influence, data generation, OSS community benefits
- **Government Contracts**: High funding, regulatory influence, security concerns
- **Open Source**: Community influence, research boosts, limited funding

### Deployment Effects
- **Data Generation**: Some deployments produce new data types
- **Research Acceleration**: Certain deployments boost specific research areas
- **Public Perception**: Success/failure impacts global trust metrics
- **Competitor Response**: May trigger defensive or offensive actions

## Research System

The research tree represents humanity's journey toward advanced AI, with each node a meaningful breakthrough.

### Research Mechanics
- **Concurrent Research**: Start with 1 slot, unlock 2-3 more through infrastructure
- **Computing Allocation**: Power splits between active research (always need 1+ active)
- **Pause/Resume**: Can pause research but progress decays (1% → 2% → 3% per turn)
- **Progress Events**: Competitor breakthroughs grant free progress
  - Formula: `Gained = EventBase × (1 - CurrentProgress)²`
  - Example: 30% event at 50% progress = 7.5% gain
  - Always provides some benefit, but can never reach 100%
- **Speed Modifiers**:
  - Computing allocation (primary factor)
  - Data quality and type availability
  - Deployment synergies
  - Prior research bonuses
- **Organization Policies**:
  - **Openness**: Share research for influence vs. keep proprietary
  - **Risk Appetite**: Fast progress with instability vs. slow and steady
  - **Ethical Framework**: Affects alignment but may slow certain paths

### Research Categories

## Alignment System

Alignment represents the complex relationship between AI capabilities and human values.

### Alignment Dimensions

1. **Deployment-Organization**
   - How well AI systems serve your stated goals
   - Can drift over time, especially with high agency
   - Affects deployment effectiveness and risk

2. **Entity Relationships**
   - Competitor alignment (cooperation vs. competition)
   - Government alignment (compliance vs. innovation)
   - Public alignment (trust vs. fear)

3. **Value Alignment**
   - Abstract principles (helpfulness, harmlessness, honesty)
   - Cultural values (varies by region and deployment)
   - Emergent values (discovered through interpretability research)

### Alignment Mechanics
- **Alignment Tax**: Highly aligned systems develop slower
- **Drift**: Systems naturally drift from initial alignment
- **Correction Cost**: Realigning systems becomes expensive
