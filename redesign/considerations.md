# Key Development Considerations

This document outlines important policy decisions and philosophical stances to consider before resetting the project. These considerations will help provide guardrails for development and ensure consistent decision-making.

## 1. Development Velocity vs. Correctness

Define the balance between moving quickly and getting things perfectly right:

- How complete must designs be before implementation begins?
- When is refactoring mandatory vs. optional?
- What level of test coverage is expected for different types of code?
- How many review cycles should code typically go through?

**Example stance:** *"We prioritize correctness for core systems (resource, research) and velocity for experimental features. Core systems require complete design and 90%+ test coverage, while experimental features can start with minimal design and tests."*

## 2. Technical Debt Policy

Create clear guidelines on technical debt management:

- What types of shortcuts are acceptable in what circumstances?
- How should known technical debt be documented?
- What criteria trigger mandatory debt repayment?
- How much of sprint capacity should be allocated to debt reduction?

**Example stance:** *"Technical debt is acceptable for UI implementations but not for game state management. All debt must be documented in code with // DEBT: comments and reviewed quarterly."*

## 3. External Dependencies Philosophy

Define your stance on third-party libraries:

- When is it appropriate to use external dependencies vs. build in-house?
- What evaluation criteria should be applied to potential dependencies?
- How should dependencies be versioned and updated?
- What security or licensing requirements must dependencies meet?

**Example stance:** *"Prefer no dependencies for core game logic. UI and utility code may use popular, well-maintained libraries with MIT/BSD licenses. Pin dependency versions and review updates monthly."*

## 4. Modifiability Priority Areas

Identify which aspects of the game must remain highly modifiable:

- Which game elements might need frequent balancing?
- What content might need to expand significantly?
- Which systems might undergo fundamental redesign?
- What aspects might modders want to customize?

**Example stance:** *"Prioritize modifiability for research tree content, event triggers, and resource formulas. These should use data-driven design patterns that support easy modification without code changes."*

## 5. Definition of Done

Establish clear completion criteria for features:

- What test coverage is required?
- What documentation must be created/updated?
- What review process must be completed?
- What performance benchmarks must be met?
- What accessibility requirements must be satisfied?

**Example stance:** *"Features are 'done' when they: have 80%+ test coverage, include README updates, pass code review, maintain 60fps on target devices, and meet WCAG A compliance."*

## 6. Error Handling Strategy

Define a consistent approach to errors:

- How should user-facing errors differ from system errors?
- What logging approach should be used for debugging?
- What recovery strategies should be implemented?
- What telemetry should be collected about errors?

**Example stance:** *"Use structured error objects with error codes. User-facing errors should be actionable and clear. Log detailed context for debugging. Systems should fail gracefully with state preservation where possible."*

## 7. Versioning Strategy

Decide how the game will evolve:

- What semantic versioning approach will be used?
- How will save file compatibility be maintained?
- How will breaking changes be handled?
- What's the update cadence and support policy?

**Example stance:** *"Follow semantic versioning. Major versions may break save compatibility with warning. Minor versions must maintain compatibility. Patches must never break anything. We'll support the last 3 major versions."*

## 8. Minimum Viable Product Definition

Clearly define what constitutes a playable game:

- What core gameplay loop is essential?
- Which systems are required vs. nice-to-have?
- What metrics indicate the game is "fun enough"?
- What minimum content is required?

**Example stance:** *"MVP requires: functional research tree with 20+ nodes, basic resource system, turn progression, and deployments. At least 15 minutes of engaging gameplay loop as measured by playtesting."*

## 9. Performance Budget

Establish performance targets and budgets:

- What are the minimum specs for the target platforms?
- What frame rate is acceptable?
- What memory limits exist?
- How should performance testing be conducted?

**Example stance:** *"Game must run at 60fps on a 5-year-old mid-range PC. Memory usage should not exceed 500MB. Each major feature must include performance testing."*

## 10. Cross-Platform Strategy

Define how the game will handle multiple platforms:

- Which platforms are targeted?
- How will platform-specific features be handled?
- What abstractions are needed for cross-platform support?
- How will testing across platforms be managed?

**Example stance:** *"Primary target is modern browsers (Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari). Differences in platform capabilities should be gracefully managed through feature detection. Test matrix covers latest two versions of each browser."*

These considerations should be discussed and decisions documented before the full project reset. Even brief positions on each topic will provide valuable guidance for development and help maintain consistency as the project evolves.
