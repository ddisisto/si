# SuperInt++ UI Redesign Principles

## Key Architecture Ideas

1. **Separation of State and Presentation**
   - Game logic should operate entirely independently of UI
   - UI should be a pure function of game state: `UI = f(state)`
   - All UI components receive state from a single source of truth

2. **Hybrid Development Approach**
   - Implement core systems with debug UI first
   - Build proper UI only after systems are stable
   - Use a unified interface for state changes (action patterns)

3. **Minimal Framework Footprint**
   - Consider Alpine.js for declarative HTML-first UI
   - Prioritize fewer lines of code and maintainability
   - Keep runtime dependencies minimal (< 100KB total)

4. **Component-Based Structure**
   - Every UI element is a composable, reusable component
   - Child components should not know about parent structure
   - Define clear interface boundaries between components

5. **State Flow Directionality**
   - User actions → dispatch events → state changes → UI updates
   - Unidirectional data flow prevents complex state bugs
   - UI never modifies state directly, only via dispatched actions

6. **Visual System Design**
   - Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) defined once
   - Consistent component patterns across all views
   - Accessibility built-in from the beginning

7. **Layered View Architecture**
   - Base layer: GameLayout (persistent elements)
   - Content layer: MainView, ResearchView, DeploymentView
   - Overlay layer: Modals, notifications, tooltips
   - Each with clear mounting/unmounting patterns

8. **Test-First Approach**
   - Core game systems fully tested without UI
   - Component tests validate rendering for different states
   - Full integration tests for critical user flows

9. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Start with functional HTML that works without JS
   - Layer in interactivity with minimal JS
   - Degrade gracefully when features aren't available

10. **Design Documentation**
    - Document all reusable components
    - Clear usage examples for each component
    - Visual state mapping for complex interactions
