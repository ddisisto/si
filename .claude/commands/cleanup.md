Please scan the source files for terms like 'placeholder', 'temp', 'legacy', 'mock', etc, and see if any of these can be removed, or need to be added ROADMAP items, etc. If there are more than a handful found, prioritise - pick one area to begin focussing on first rather than trying to fix everything in one-shot.
