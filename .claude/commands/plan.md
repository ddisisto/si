Analyze the current implementation status against design docs and roadmap for: "$ARGUMENTS". If no specific feature is provided, check the current branch name and recent commits to determine focus.

1. First check the relevant design document in the docs/ directory
2. Compare current implementation (if any) against the design
3. Identify missing components or divergences between design and implementation
4. Present a clear, structured implementation plan with specific steps
5. If the feature has not been started, propose an initial implementation approach with clear first steps
6. If design documentation is missing or insufficient, note this as the first item to address

The goal is to provide a clear bridge between design and implementation, identifying concrete next steps while ensuring alignment with the overall project architecture.
