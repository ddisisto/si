  // Historical context
  historicalContext: `
    The concept of recursive self-improvement dates back to I.J. Good's 1965 speculation about
    an "intelligence explosion," where an AI capable of improving itself could rapidly surpass
    human intelligence. This idea became a cornerstone of singularity theories and AI risk assessment.
  `,
  
  // Technical details
  technicalDetails: `
    Recursive self-improvement involves several capabilities working in concert:
    1. Self-analysis to identify bottlenecks and limitations
    2. Architecture search to discover better designs
    3. Automated coding and testing to implement improvements
    4. Meta-learning to improve the improvement process itself
    
    The difficulty lies in creating improvement methods that preserve goal alignment
    through successive iterations.
  `,
  
  // Development considerations
  developmentConsiderations: `
    The development of recursive self-improvement capabilities represents a point of
    no return in AI development. Once systems can improve themselves, the pace of
    advancement may accelerate beyond human control or understanding. 
    
    Strong oversight mechanisms and alignment techniques are essential prerequisites.

  // Strategic importance
  strategicImportance: `
    This capability represents a watershed moment in AI development. Organizations
    that achieve it gain a potentially insurmountable lead in capability development,
    but also assume enormous responsibility for the safe deployment of such systems.
    
    The development of recursive self-improvement is likely to trigger significant
    geopolitical and competitive responses.
