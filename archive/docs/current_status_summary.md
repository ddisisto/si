# Current Status Summary

## Current Branch: feature/refactor-research-tree-view
This branch now contains ALL the work:
1. PR #13 - ResearchTreeView refactoring (pending completion)
2. PR #15 - EventBus Architecture clarification (MERGED into this branch âœ…)

## What's Complete
- ResearchTreeView refactored from 1064 to 315 lines
- 5 child components created
- EventBus architecture clarified and implemented
- All components now use unified setGameEngine() approach
- Helper methods (emit/subscribe) added to UIComponent
- Nodes are rendering correctly (48 visible nodes)

## Remaining Issues to Fix

### Research Tree Child Components Not Rendering
- Controls component not showing
- Filters component not showing  
- Info panel not showing
- Connections may not be rendering

### Root Cause (Likely)
The child components need to be initialized with gameEngine properly. The new architecture from PR #15 should help with this.

### 3. Testing Checklist
After fixes are applied:
- [ ] Verify all child components render
- [ ] Test zoom/pan controls  
- [ ] Test filter functionality
- [ ] Test node selection and info panel
- [ ] Test research actions (start, allocate, cancel)

## Next Steps
1. Merge main into current branch to get PR #15 changes
2. Update ResearchTreeView to use new architecture
3. Fix remaining rendering issues
4. Complete manual testing
5. Update PR #13 and merge

## Architecture Notes
The new architecture pattern is:
```typescript
// Component initialization
class MyComponent extends UIComponent {
  private initializeComponents(): void {
    this.childComponent = new ChildComponent();
    if (this.gameEngine) {
      this.childComponent.setGameEngine(this.gameEngine);
    }
  }
  
  // Use helper methods for events
  private handleAction(): void {
    this.emit('action:something', { data });
    this.subscribe('game:updated', this.handleUpdate);
  }
}
```
