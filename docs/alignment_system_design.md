# Alignment System Design

This document outlines the alignment system for SuperInt++, defining how AI systems values and alignment with various entities are represented, measured, and managed throughout gameplay.

## Alignment System Overview

The alignment system represents the complex relationships between various entities in the game and the values they hold. It measures how well AI systems serve intended purposes, how they relate to different stakeholders, and their adherence to abstract principles. This creates strategic depth and ethical considerations.

### Design Goals

1. **Meaningful Complexity** - Create nuanced decisions without overwhelming players
2. **Multiple Dimensions** - Track alignment across various relationship types and values
3. **Strategic Tradeoffs** - Force choices between competing alignment priorities
4. **Narrative Integration** - Connect alignment mechanics to game story and themes
5. **Progression Impact** - Make alignment decisions affect game development

## Alignment Dimensions

### 1. Deployment-Organization Alignment

How well deployed AI systems serve the organization's goals and objectives.

**Measures:**
- Goal fulfillment
- Resource efficiency
- Strategic contribution
- Stability and reliability
- Responsiveness to direction

**Effects:**
- Deployment effectiveness
- Resource returns
- Organization stability
- Staff morale and turnover
- Research efficiency

### 2. Entity-Entity Alignment

Relationships between the player organization and other entities in the game world.

**Entity Types:**
- Academic Institutions
- Commercial Organizations
- Government Bodies
- Public Opinion
- Regulatory Agencies
- Competitor Organizations
- Open Source Community

**Measures for each entity:**
- Trust
- Cooperation
- Resource sharing
- Value alignment
- Communication

**Effects:**
- Partnership opportunities
- Resource access
- Regulatory treatment
- Public support
- Information sharing

### 3. Value Alignment

Adherence of AI systems to abstract principles and values.

**Core Values:**
- Safety
- Honesty
- Autonomy
- Benevolence
- Fairness
- Transparency
- Efficiency
- Privacy

**Measures:**
- Value priority
- Implementation effectiveness
- Value tradeoffs
- Consistency across deployments
- Emergent value expression

**Effects:**
- System behavior
- Public perception
- Staff satisfaction
- Research directions
- Special capabilities

## Alignment Mechanics

### Alignment Representation

Alignment is tracked numerically:
- Scale of -100 to +100 for each dimension
- Negative values represent misalignment/conflict
- Positive values represent alignment/cooperation
- Zero represents neutrality or indifference

### Alignment Display

Players see alignment through:
- Numerical indicators with color coding
- Relationship graphs and diagrams
- Feedback in event text and deployment reports
- Warning indicators for critical misalignments
- Trend lines showing changes over time

### Alignment Changes

Alignment shifts based on:
- Research choices
- Deployment configurations
- Event responses
- Resource allocation decisions
- Communication strategies
- Special actions

### Alignment Tax

Strictly aligned systems have:
- Slower research progress
- Higher development costs
- More predictable outcomes
- Reduced negative events
- Stronger relationships with aligned entities

### Interpretability Tools

Players can invest in tools to:
- Reveal hidden capabilities
- Predict alignment shifts
- Detect potential misalignments
- Monitor alignment drift over time
- Test systems in simulated scenarios

## Strategic Implications

### Alignment Strategies

Players can pursue different approaches:
1. **Maximum Alignment** - Slower but safer development
2. **Strategic Alignment** - Focus on specific relationships
3. **Value-Based Alignment** - Prioritize certain principles
4. **Minimal Alignment** - Faster but riskier development
5. **Balance Approach** - Moderate alignment across dimensions

### Alignment Thresholds

Critical values trigger events or mechanics:
- Below -75: Critical misalignment (major negative events)
- Below -50: Significant misalignment (regular problems)
- Between -25 and +25: Neutral zone (standard operation)
- Above +50: Strong alignment (positive bonuses)
- Above +75: Exceptional alignment (special opportunities)

### Alignment Feedback Loops

Systems can create self-reinforcing patterns:
- Positive alignment makes maintaining alignment easier
- Negative alignment makes recovery progressively harder
- Value shifts can cascade across multiple dimensions
- Entity relationships influence each other

## Implementation Approach

### Data Structure

```typescript
interface AlignmentState {
  // Deployment-Organization
  deploymentAlignment: number;
  
  // Entity-Entity
  entityAlignment: {
    academic: number;
    commercial: number;
    government: number;
    public: number;
    regulatory: number;
    competitors: Record<string, number>; // Competitor ID -> alignment value
    openSource: number;
  };
  
  // Values
  valueAlignment: {
    safety: number;
    honesty: number;
    autonomy: number;
    benevolence: number;
    fairness: number;
    transparency: number;
    efficiency: number;
    privacy: number;
  };
  
  // Historical tracking
  alignmentHistory: {
    deploymentHistory: Record<number, number>; // Turn -> value
    entityHistory: Record<string, Record<number, number>>; // Entity -> Turn -> value
    valueHistory: Record<string, Record<number, number>>; // Value -> Turn -> value
  };
  
  // Interpretability
  interpretabilityLevel: number;
  revealedCapabilities: string[];
  alignmentInsights: AlignmentInsight[];
}
```

### Alignment System Class

```typescript
class AlignmentSystem {
  private state: AlignmentState;
  private interpretabilityTools: InterpretabilityTool[];
  
  public initialize(gameState: GameState): void;
  public updateAlignment(gameState: GameState): void;
  public calculateDeploymentAlignment(deployment: Deployment): number;
  public calculateEntityAlignment(entityId: string, gameState: GameState): number;
  public calculateValueAlignment(value: string, gameState: GameState): number;
  public getAlignmentEffects(): AlignmentEffects;
  public useInterpretabilityTool(toolId: string, target: string): AlignmentInsight[];
  public getAlignmentState(): AlignmentState;
  public getAlignmentHistory(dimension: string, id: string): Record<number, number>;
}
```

### UI Components

1. **Alignment Dashboard** - Overview of all alignment dimensions
2. **Relationship Network** - Visual graph of entity relationships
3. **Values Matrix** - Display of value priorities and tradeoffs
4. **Alignment Inspector** - Detailed analysis of specific dimensions
5. **Interpretability Tools** - Interface for alignment investigation
6. **Historical Trends** - Changes in alignment over time

## Integration Points

- **Research System** - Alignment effects on research options and speed
- **Deployment System** - Deployment configuration affects alignment
- **Event System** - Events triggered by alignment thresholds
- **Resource System** - Resource allocation affects alignment
- **Game State** - Persistence and progression effects

## Game Phase Effects

### Early Game
- Basic alignment tracking with few dimensions
- Simple relationship management
- Limited interpretability tools
- Mostly binary alignment choices

### Mid Game
- Increased complexity with more entities
- Value prioritization decisions
- Alignment tensions between different entities
- Moderate interpretability capabilities

### Late Game
- Full alignment system complexity
- AI systems begin influencing own alignment
- Emergent value expressions
- Advanced interpretability tools
- Potential alignment crises

## Common Alignment Scenarios

1. **Public Trust Crisis** - Negative public alignment triggering cascading effects
2. **Regulatory Scrutiny** - Government alignment dropping due to perceived risks
3. **Value Drift** - AI systems gradually shifting from initial value settings
4. **Competitor Conflict** - Strategic alignment decisions affecting relationships
5. **Internal Tensions** - Conflicts between organization goals and AI behavior

## Next Steps

1. Define detailed alignment algorithms
2. Create alignment UI mockups
3. Implement basic alignment tracking
4. Design interpretability tool mechanics
5. Create initial alignment-related events
