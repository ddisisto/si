# Resource Tracking System Implementation Plan

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for creating the resource tracking system as part of Phase 1 of the SuperInt++ development roadmap.

## Background

The resource tracking system is a core component of the game's state management architecture. It builds upon the existing resource system design (defined in `docs/resource_system_design.md`) and state management approach (defined in `docs/state_management_design.md`).

Based on review of the current codebase, we have:
- Basic resource state structure implemented in `GameState.ts`
- Initial `ResourceSystem` class with preliminary methods
- Core state management with `GameStateManager`
- Turn-based progression system

## Implementation Goals

1. Create a comprehensive resource tracking system that:
   - Tracks all resources accurately
   - Allows allocation and deallocation of computing power
   - Manages resource generation per turn
   - Supports resource spending and capacity limits
   - Provides clear UI for resource visualization
   - Enables future integration with research and deployment systems

2. Enhance the user interface to:
   - Display current resource levels
   - Show allocation status
   - Provide intuitive allocation controls
   - Visualize resource changes

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Resource State Enhancements

1. Enhance `ResourceState` interfaces:
   - Add more detailed tracking of computing allocation
   - Implement detailed data tier representation
   - Add resource history for trend visualization

2. Implement Resource Reducer:
   - Create dedicated reducer for resource actions
   - Define specific action types for resource operations
   - Ensure immutable state updates

### Phase 2: ResourceSystem Completion

1. Expand `ResourceSystem` capabilities:
   - Implement all methods outlined in design docs
   - Add detailed allocation tracking
   - Create resource cap management
   - Implement resource effects calculation

2. Connect to Event System:
   - Subscribe to relevant game events
   - Emit resource-related events

### Phase 3: Resource Allocation UI

1. Create allocation controls:
   - Implement allocation sliders for computing
   - Add buttons for resource spending
   - Create resource transfer interface

2. Update resource display:
   - Enhance existing resource panel
   - Add detailed resource tooltips
   - Create allocation visualization

### Phase 4: Resource Effects

1. Implement resource effects system:
   - Create mechanism for resources to affect gameplay
   - Implement resource boosters and multipliers
   - Connect resources to other game systems

2. Create resource notifications:
   - Add UI elements for resource changes
   - Implement resource warnings (low/critical)
   - Create resource milestone notifications

## Detailed Tasks

### 1. Core Resource State Enhancements

- [ ] Update `ComputingResource` interface to track allocation history
- [ ] Enhance `DataResource` interface with quality levels and tier details
- [ ] Add `ResourceHistory` to track resource changes over time
- [ ] Create utility functions for resource calculations
- [ ] Implement basic resource validation

### 2. Resource Reducer Implementation

- [ ] Create action types:
  - [ ] `ALLOCATE_COMPUTING`
  - [ ] `DEALLOCATE_COMPUTING`
  - [ ] `UPDATE_RESOURCE`
  - [ ] `GENERATE_RESOURCES`
  - [ ] `SPEND_RESOURCES`
- [ ] Implement resource reducer with all action handlers
- [ ] Create resource-specific selectors
- [ ] Add resource validation in reducer

### 3. ResourceSystem Enhancement

- [ ] Complete `allocateComputing` functionality
- [ ] Implement `deallocateComputing` method
- [ ] Enhance `generateResources` with scaling factors
- [ ] Add resource cap management
- [ ] Implement `canAfford` for multiple resource types
- [ ] Create `getResourceEffects` method
- [ ] Add detailed resource metrics

### 4. UI Implementation

- [ ] Enhance `ResourcePanel` component:
  - [ ] Add detailed resource displays
  - [ ] Create allocation indicators
  - [ ] Implement resource trend visualization
- [ ] Create allocation controls:
  - [ ] Sliders for computing allocation
  - [ ] Buttons for resource spending
  - [ ] Visual feedback for allocation changes
- [ ] Add resource tooltips with detailed information
- [ ] Implement resource notifications for important changes

### 5. Turn Integration

- [ ] Enhance turn-based resource generation
- [ ] Implement resource carry-over between turns
- [ ] Add turn-based resource cap scaling
- [ ] Create resource prediction for next turn

### 6. Testing and Balancing

- [ ] Create unit tests for resource calculations
- [ ] Test resource allocation limits and validation
- [ ] Verify resource persistence in save/load
- [ ] Balance initial resource values
- [ ] Test resource scaling across multiple turns

## Implementation Approach

1. **Test-First Development**:
   - Define expectations and behavior before implementation
   - Create test cases for resource operations
   - Verify resource state integrity

2. **Incremental Integration**:
   - Build and test one component at a time
   - Integrate with existing systems progressively
   - Maintain backward compatibility

3. **UI Development**:
   - Create basic UI elements first
   - Enhance with detailed visualizations
   - Add interactive controls last

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update technical documentation with implementation details
   - Create developer documentation for resource system usage
   - Add user documentation for resource mechanics

## Timeline

Estimated timeline for implementation:

1. Core Resource State Enhancements: 1 day
2. Resource Reducer Implementation: 1 day
3. ResourceSystem Enhancement: 2 days
4. UI Implementation: 2 days
5. Turn Integration: 1 day
6. Testing and Balancing: 1 day

Total estimated time: 8 days

## Documentation Updates

The following documentation will be updated:

1. `docs/resource_system_design.md` - Update with implementation details
2. `docs/state_management_design.md` - Add resource reducer details
3. Update ROADMAP.md to reflect progress

## Future Considerations

1. Integration with Research System for resource costs
2. Connection to Deployment System for resource generation
3. Advanced resource visualization with charts
4. Resource forecasting and planning tools
5. Resource alerts and warnings system
