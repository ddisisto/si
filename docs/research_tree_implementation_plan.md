# Research Tree Implementation Plan

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for the research tree visualization system in SuperInt++, expanding on the high-level design in [Research Tree Design](./research_tree_design.md).

## Overview

The research tree visualization is a core gameplay mechanic that allows players to view, interact with, and manage their AI research progress. This implementation will focus on creating a visually appealing, intuitive, and functionally rich interface for the research tree.

## Philosophical Alignment

Following the principles in PHILOSOPHY.md:

1. **Continuous > Categorical** - Research progress will be visualized as continuous percentages rather than discrete states, with smooth transitions between states.

2. **Progressive Revelation** - The interface will reveal complexity gradually, starting with basic nodes and connections, then revealing deeper mechanics as players progress.

3. **Anti-maximization Design** - Multiple valid research paths will be visually reinforced, avoiding "obvious best choices" through layout and design.

4. **Meaningful Causality Chains** - Visual connections between nodes will clearly illustrate dependencies and effects.

5. **Metaphor-mechanic Coherence** - The research visualization will reflect real AI development processes through its structure and progression patterns.

## Technical Approach

### Component Structure

```
/src
  /ui
    /components
      /research
        ResearchTreeView.ts     - Main container component
        ResearchNode.ts         - Individual node component
        NodeConnection.ts       - Connection rendering
        ResearchControls.ts     - UI controls for research
        ResearchInfoPanel.ts    - Detailed node information
        CategorySection.ts      - Category grouping component
  /systems
    ResearchSystem.ts           - Research progression logic
  /types
    Research.ts                 - Research data types
  /data
    ResearchData.ts             - Initial research tree data
```

### State Management

The research tree will follow the application's overall state management pattern:

1. **State Structure**
   - Research nodes in a normalized structure
   - Active research tracking
   - Completion status
   - Node positioning data

2. **Actions**
   - `START_RESEARCH` - Begin researching a node
   - `ALLOCATE_COMPUTE` - Assign computing to research
   - `COMPLETE_RESEARCH` - Mark research as complete
   - `UPDATE_RESEARCH_PROGRESS` - Track progress updates
   - `SET_NODE_POSITION` - Update visual positioning

3. **Events**
   - `action:start_research` - UI request to start research
   - `game:research_started` - Notification that research began
   - `game:research_progress` - Progress update
   - `game:research_completed` - Research completion
   - `ui:research_view_focus` - Focus the view on specific node

### Rendering Approach

The research tree will use DOM-based rendering with:

1. **Grid Layout** - CSS Grid for overall positioning
2. **SVG Connections** - Lines between nodes using SVG
3. **HTML Components** - Nodes as interactive DOM elements
4. **CSS Transitions** - Smooth state changes
5. **Virtualization** - For performance with large trees

## Integration Points

1. **Resource System** - Computing allocation and requirements
2. **Event System** - Research-triggered events
3. **Turn System** - Progress updates during turns
4. **UI Manager** - Component registration and updates
5. **Game State** - Research state storage and updates

## Next Steps

1. Update the ROADMAP.md with detailed implementation tasks
2. Create the basic data structures for research nodes
3. Implement the foundation for the research tree visualization
4. Begin working on the node rendering system
