# Deployment System Design

This document outlines the deployment system for SuperInt++, defining how AI systems are released into the game world, their effects, and interactions.

## Deployment System Overview

The deployment system allows players to apply their AI research into functional systems that generate resources, influence the world, and advance their organization's goals. Deployments represent the practical implementation of AI capabilities.

### Design Goals

1. **Strategic Choices** - Create meaningful decisions about how to use AI capabilities
2. **Resource Dynamics** - Balance between research and application of technology
3. **Worldbuilding** - Show the impact of AI on the game world
4. **Feedback Loop** - Create returns that can be reinvested in research
5. **Risk/Reward** - Balance potential benefits against possible negative outcomes

## Deployment Mechanics

### Deployment Slots

Players have a limited number of concurrent deployment slots:
- Start with 1-2 slots based on organization type
- Expand to maximum of 5-7 slots through research
- Each slot represents a significant application of AI technology
- Slots vary in scale and specialization based on research path

### Deployment Creation

To create a deployment:
1. Player selects an available slot
2. Chooses deployment type based on unlocked options
3. Allocates computing resources
4. Sets configuration options (if applicable)
5. Confirms deployment activation

### Deployment Management

Active deployments:
- Consume allocated computing resources continuously
- Generate various benefits based on type and configuration
- May create risks or side effects
- Can be modified within limits (resource allocation, parameters)
- Can be decommissioned to free the slot

## Deployment Types

## Deployment Attributes

Each deployment has:

- **Type** - The category of deployment
- **Name** - Player-defined or auto-generated
- **Computing Allocation** - Resources devoted to operation
- **Capabilities** - Functions based on completed research
- **Effects** - Ongoing impacts on game state
- **Risks** - Potential negative outcomes
- **Scale** - Reach and impact of the deployment
- **Efficiency** - Resource utilization effectiveness
- **Configuration** - Customizable parameters

## Risk and Opportunity System

### Data Generation and Refinement

Deployments can generate or refine data resources:

**Data Generation:**
- Some deployment types create new data as a byproduct
- Generated data quality depends on deployment configuration
- Computing allocation affects generation rate and quality

**Data Refinement:**
- Deployments can process existing data to improve quality
- Requires computing resources and source data access
- May accelerate decay rate of source data as it becomes obsolete
- Creates higher-quality derivatives of existing data sets

### Risk Factors

Deployments generate risks based on:
- Capabilities included
- Scale of deployment
- Resource allocation
- Configuration choices
- Research choices (especially alignment)
- External factors (events, competitor actions)

### Risk Types

- **Technical Failures** - System malfunctions or limitations
- **Security Vulnerabilities** - External exploits or attacks
- **Misuse** - Harmful applications by users
- **Unintended Consequences** - Unforeseen effects
- **Alignment Failures** - System behavior diverging from intent
- **Public Backlash** - Negative perception and response

### Opportunity Factors

Deployments create opportunities through:
- User interactions
- Data generation
- Market presence
- Demonstrated capabilities
- Technological synergies

### Opportunity Types

- **Partnerships** - Collaboration possibilities
- **Market Expansion** - New application domains
- **Resource Boosts** - Unexpected efficiency gains
- **Capability Discovery** - New potential applications
- **Positive Public Response** - Reputation benefits

## Deployment Lifecycle

1. **Planning** - Pre-deployment preparation and design
2. **Launch** - Initial deployment with startup effects
3. **Growth** - Scaling period with increasing returns
4. **Maturity** - Stable operation with consistent effects
5. **Evolution** - Adaptation to changing conditions
6. **Decline/Renewal** - Decreasing effectiveness or upgrade

## Global Influence Map

Deployments influence the game world visualized through a global map:

- **Regional Presence** - Where deployments have impact
- **Influence Types** - Different kinds of presence (commercial, research, etc.)
- **Competitor Activity** - Other organizations' deployments
- **Resistance/Acceptance** - How different regions respond
- **Special Zones** - Areas with unique properties or opportunities

## Implementation Approach

### Data Structure

```typescript
interface DeploymentConfig {
  parameters: Record<string, number | string | boolean>;
  emphasis: string[]; // Capability emphasis
  safetySettings: Record<string, number>;
}

interface Deployment {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: DeploymentType;
  computingAllocation: number;
  capabilities: string[]; // IDs of capabilities from research
  config: DeploymentConfig;
  effects: Effect[];
  risks: Risk[];
  opportunities: Opportunity[];
  status: DeploymentStatus;
  metrics: Record<string, number>; // Performance metrics
  regions: string[]; // Active regions
  createdTurn: number;
  lifeCycleStage: LifeCycleStage;
}

interface DeploymentSlot {
  id: string;
  available: boolean;
  specialization?: string; // Optional slot specialization
  deployment?: Deployment;
  unlockRequirements?: string[]; // Research requirements
}
```

### Deployment System Class

```typescript
class DeploymentSystem {
  private slots: DeploymentSlot[];
  private deploymentTemplates: Record<string, DeploymentTemplate>;
  private activeDeployments: Deployment[];
  
  public getAvailableSlots(): DeploymentSlot[];
  public getDeploymentOptions(): DeploymentTemplate[];
  public createDeployment(slotId: string, templateId: string, config: DeploymentConfig): boolean;
  public modifyDeployment(deploymentId: string, changes: Partial<DeploymentConfig>): boolean;
  public decommissionDeployment(deploymentId: string): boolean;
  public processDeploymentEffects(gameState: GameState): void;
  public checkDeploymentRisks(gameState: GameState): Risk[];
  public generateOpportunities(gameState: GameState): Opportunity[];
  public updateDeploymentStatus(gameState: GameState): void;
  public getDeploymentDetails(deploymentId: string): Deployment;
}
```

### UI Components

1. **Deployment Manager** - Overview of all deployments
2. **Deployment Creator** - Interface for creating new deployments
3. **Deployment Detail View** - Information about specific deployment
4. **Global Map View** - Visualization of deployment influence
5. **Risk Monitor** - Tracking potential issues
6. **Performance Dashboard** - Metrics and statistics

## Integration Points

- **Research System** - Capabilities unlocked for deployment
- **Resource System** - Computing allocation and returns
- **Event System** - Triggers and responses to deployment activities
- **Global Map** - Visualization of influence
- **Game State** - Persistence and progression effects

## Balance Considerations

- Computing allocation creates direct tradeoff with research
- Deployment benefits scale non-linearly with allocation
- Risk increases with capability power and reduced alignment
- Early deployments provide modest but essential returns
- Late-game deployments can transform gameplay significantly

## Next Steps

1. Design deployment template structure
2. Create initial set of deployment types
3. Implement basic deployment management UI
4. Develop effect calculation system
5. Design global influence map visualization
