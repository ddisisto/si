# EventBus Architecture Refactor - Next Steps

This document outlines the remaining work and considerations before merging the `fix/eventbus-architecture` branch into `main`.

## Completed Work

1. **Core Architecture Changes**
   - Updated UIComponent base class to remove direct eventBus property
   - All components now access eventBus through gameEngine reference
   - Added helper methods `emit()` and `subscribe()` for cleaner event handling
   - Removed all `setEventBus()` calls in favor of `setGameEngine()`

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Clarified UIComponent purpose vs simple HTML elements
   - Added button styling standards to technical architecture
   - Created UI Component Best Practices in CLAUDE.md
   - Updated event taxonomy in eventbus_design.md

## Pre-Merge Checklist

- [ ] **Testing**
  - [ ] Run full application test with `npm run dev`
  - [ ] Test save/load functionality works correctly
  - [ ] Verify research tree navigation
  - [ ] Check turn controls functionality
  - [ ] Confirm all UI events are properly handled

- [ ] **Code Review**
  - [ ] Ensure no remaining references to direct eventBus access
  - [ ] Verify TypeScript types are properly updated
  - [ ] Check for any console.error logs that were for debugging

- [ ] **Performance Validation**
  - [ ] Monitor browser console for any event registration issues
  - [ ] Check memory usage for event subscriptions
  - [ ] Verify no duplicate event handlers

## Future Refactoring Opportunities

1. **Event Unsubscription**
   - Currently missing cleanup in component unmount
   - Should add unsubscribe mechanism to prevent memory leaks
   - Consider implementing in UIComponent base class

2. **Event Type Safety**
   - Create TypeScript enums or constants for event names
   - Add type definitions for event payloads
   - Consider typed event emitter pattern

3. **Component Testing**
   - Add unit tests for UIComponent base class
   - Test event emission and subscription patterns
   - Mock gameEngine for isolated component tests

4. **Migration Path**
   - Document migration guide for any external code
   - Update any example code in documentation
   - Consider deprecation warnings if needed

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Manual Testing** (30 mins)
   - Launch the application
   - Test all major user flows
   - Verify no regressions

2. **Code Cleanup** (15 mins)
   - Remove any debugging console.logs
   - Final TypeScript check: `npm run typecheck`
   - Lint check if available

3. **PR Update** (10 mins)
   - Update PR description with testing results
   - Add any screenshots if UI changed
   - Request review if available

4. **Merge Strategy**
   - Squash and merge to keep history clean
   - Update any dependent branches after merge
   - Delete feature branch after successful merge

## Long-term Considerations

- Monitor for any event-related issues post-merge
- Consider creating an event debugging tool
- Document common event patterns for future developers
- Plan for event versioning as the game evolves

## Notes

This refactor significantly improves the architecture by:
- Reducing coupling between components
- Centralizing event access patterns
- Making the codebase more maintainable
- Setting clear guidelines for future development

The changes are backwards compatible in behavior but not in API, so any code outside this repository would need updates.
