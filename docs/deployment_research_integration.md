# Deployment-Research Integration System

This document outlines the integration between the Deployment System and Research System in SuperInt++, describing how deployed AI systems generate specialized data that enables and accelerates research pathways.

## Core Mechanics

### 1. Compute Allocation Framework

- **Global Compute Split**: Players allocate a percentage of total compute resources between Research and Deployments
- **Base Research Distribution**: Research compute is evenly distributed among all active research projects
- **Priority System**: Research projects can be assigned priorities (High/Normal/Low) that multiply base allocation (1.5x/1.0x/0.5x)
- **Deployment Compute**: Remaining compute goes to deployment slots, allocated manually by the player

### 2. Deployment-Research Feedback Loop

- **Data Generation**: Active deployments generate specialized data types each turn
- **Research Requirements**: Advanced research nodes require specific data types only available from deployments
- **Acceleration Effects**: Deployments provide percentage boosts to related research categories
- **Research Unlocks**: Completed research unlocks new deployment types and enhances existing ones

### 3. Strategic Progression

- **Early Game**: Basic research possible with public data, simple deployments
- **Mid Game**: Specialized deployments become necessary to progress down advanced research paths
- **Late Game**: Complex research requires diverse deployment portfolio generating multiple data types
- **Endgame**: Self-improving AI can potentially replace certain deployment requirements

## Implementation Details

### Data Type System

Data is represented in multiple dimensions:
1. **Tier**: Public, Specialized, Proprietary, Synthetic
2. **Domain**: General, Scientific, Business, Creative, Social, etc.
3. **Modality**: Text, Image, Audio, Video, Multimodal, Physical
4. **Quality**: 1-10 rating affecting research speed bonus
5. **Quantity**: Accumulates over time, may decay if deployment is removed

```typescript
interface DataType {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  tier: DataTier;
  domain: DataDomain;
  modality: DataModality;
  quality: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

### Deployment Effects

Each deployment generates the following effects:
1. **Data Generation**: Produces X units of specific data types per turn
2. **Category Boosts**: Provides percentage-based research acceleration to specific categories
3. **Resource Effects**: Generates or consumes other resources (funding, influence)
4. **Special Unlocks**: May unlock unique research nodes when combined with certain conditions

```typescript
interface DeploymentEffects {
  dataGeneration: Record<string, number>; // dataTypeId -> amount per turn
  researchBoosts: Record<string, number>; // categoryId -> percentage boost
  resourceEffects: Record<string, number>; // resourceId -> amount per turn
  specialUnlocks?: string[]; // IDs of specially unlocked research nodes
}
```

### Research Requirements

Research node requirements include:
1. **Compute Cost**: Base compute required to complete
2. **Prerequisite Nodes**: Research that must be completed first
3. **Data Requirements**: Data types and quantities needed to begin research
4. **Deployment Requirements**: Specific deployments that must be active (mid-late game)

```typescript
interface ResearchRequirements {
  computeCost: number;
  prerequisites: string[];
  dataRequirements: {
    dataTypeId: string;
    minQuantity: number;
    minQuality?: number;
  }[];
  deploymentRequirements?: string[]; // For advanced nodes only
}
```

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Slot Limitations**: Limited deployment slots force tough choices about which data to generate
2. **Compute Tradeoffs**: More compute to deployments = more data but slower direct research progress
3. **Timing Windows**: Certain research may only be feasible during specific game phases
4. **Competitor Pressure**: Strategic advantage from deploying in domains before competitors
5. **Specialization vs. Breadth**: Deep specialized deployments vs. broad coverage of multiple domains
6. **Risk Management**: Higher-impact deployments generate better data but create more risk exposure

## UI Integration

1. **Research View**:
   - Shows data requirements for each node
   - Indicates which deployments provide needed data
   - Displays acceleration bonuses from current deployments

2. **Deployment View**:
   - Shows data types generated by each deployment
   - Lists research paths accelerated or enabled
   - Provides management UI for compute allocation

3. **Resource Panel**:
   - Displays current data inventory with quality metrics
   - Shows compute allocation split between research/deployment
   - Tracks data generation rates from all sources

## Balance Considerations

- Early-game research should be possible without specialized deployments
- Mid-game progression gates create natural pacing without feeling arbitrary
- Multiple viable paths ensure no single "correct" deployment strategy
- Balanced advantages for different organization types (academic gets research bonuses, big tech gets deployment bonuses)
- Scaling costs create natural diminishing returns for both research and deployments

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Basic research and deployment systems as separate mechanics
2. **Phase 2**: Simple feedback loop with deployment category bonuses to research
3. **Phase 3**: Data type generation from deployments
4. **Phase 4**: Research requirements based on deployment-generated data
5. **Phase 5**: Special unlocks and advanced integration features
